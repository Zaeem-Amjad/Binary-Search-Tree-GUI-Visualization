Binary Search Tree Project Documentation

1. Introduction
Data structures are a fundamental part of computer science and software engineering. They provide systematic ways to organize, store, and manage data efficiently. Among all data structures, tree-based structures are especially powerful because they represent hierarchical relationships naturally.
This project focuses on the implementation of Binary Search Trees (BST) and two of their balanced variants: AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees, using the C++ programming language. The system allows users to interactively perform operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, visualization, and persistent storage.
The goal of this project is not only to implement these data structures but also to demonstrate their differences in balancing strategies, performance, and real-world usage through a single unified interface.

2. Overview of Tree Data Structures
A tree is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has:
•	A root node
•	Zero or more child nodes
•	Leaf nodes that have no children
A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and right child.
Tree structures are widely used in:
•	Searching algorithms
•	Database indexing
•	Compiler design
•	File systems
•	Artificial intelligence
Binary trees form the foundation for more advanced tree structures such as Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees.

3. Binary Search Tree (BST) Concept
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree that follows specific ordering rules:
•	The value of every node in the left subtree is smaller than the root node.
•	The value of every node in the right subtree is greater than the root node.
•	Both left and right subtrees are themselves Binary Search Trees.
These properties allow BSTs to perform search operations efficiently. On average, insertion, deletion, and search operations take O(log n) time. However, if the tree becomes skewed, performance can degrade to O(n).

4. BST Implementation Details
In this project, the BST is implemented using a BSTNode structure. Each node contains:
•	An integer key
•	An integer value
•	A pointer to the left child
•	A pointer to the right child
•	A pointer to the parent node
The BST class provides the following core functionalities:
•	Insertion of nodes based on BST rules
•	Deletion using standard BST deletion logic
•	Searching with depth tracking
•	Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
•	Tree visualization using a 2D matrix
•	File storage and loading using preorder traversal
The parent pointer simplifies node replacement during deletion and restructuring.

5. Tree Traversals
Tree traversal refers to visiting all nodes in a specific order. This project supports three traversal techniques:
Inorder Traversal
•	Left → Root → Right
•	Produces sorted output for BSTs
Preorder Traversal
•	Root → Left → Right
•	Useful for saving tree structure
Postorder Traversal
•	Left → Right → Root
•	Used for deleting trees and memory cleanup
Traversal results are displayed clearly for educational understanding.

6. AVL Tree Concept
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree. It maintains balance by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.
This height difference is known as the balance factor:
Balance Factor = Height(Left Subtree) – Height(Right Subtree)

If the balance factor exceeds the allowed range, the tree automatically performs rotations to restore balance.

7. AVL Tree Implementation
The AVL Tree is implemented as a subclass of the BST, allowing reuse of traversal and utility functions.
Key AVL features include:
•	Height calculation
•	Balance factor computation
•	Left rotation
•	Right rotation
•	Double rotations (Left-Right and Right-Left)
After every insertion or deletion, the tree is rebalanced to ensure logarithmic height. This guarantees O(log n) performance even in the worst case.

8. Red-Black Tree Concept
A Red-Black Tree is another type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree. Each node is assigned a color: Red or Black.
The Red-Black Tree follows these rules:
1.	Every node is either red or black
2.	The root is always black
3.	Red nodes cannot have red children
4.	Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes has the same number of black nodes
These rules ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced.

9. Red-Black Tree Implementation
The Red-Black Tree is implemented using RBNode and RBTree classes.
Key operations include:
•	Color-based insertion fix-up
•	Rotation operations
•	Recoloring during insertions and deletions
•	Complex delete fix-up logic to preserve Red-Black properties
Compared to AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees perform fewer rotations, making them more efficient in systems with frequent insertions and deletions.

10. Tree Visualization and File Handling
This project includes advanced visualization features:
•	Trees are printed in a 2D structured format
•	Red-Black nodes show color indicators (R) or (B)
File handling is implemented using:
•	Preorder traversal for saving tree structure
•	Recursive loading to rebuild trees from files
Each tree type is stored separately:
•	bst.txt
•	avl.txt
•	rb.txt
This ensures data persistence between program executions.

11. TreeManager Class
The TreeManager class acts as a controller that integrates all tree structures.
Responsibilities include:
•	Switching between BST, AVL, and Red-Black Trees
•	Managing insert, delete, search, and traversal operations
•	Handling screen clearing and user interaction
•	Coordinating file saving and loading
This design follows good object-oriented principles such as abstraction and separation of concerns.

12. Main Function and User Interface
The main() function provides a menu-driven interface that:
•	Allows users to select the tree type
•	Provides operation choices
•	Handles user input validation
•	Maintains program flow
This interactive design makes the project user-friendly and suitable for demonstrations and academic evaluation.

13. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees using C++. It highlights:
•	Structural differences
•	Balancing strategies
•	Performance trade-offs
•	Practical applications
By combining theoretical concepts with practical implementation, this project serves as a strong educational resource for understanding tree-based data structures.
